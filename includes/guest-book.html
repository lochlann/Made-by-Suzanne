				<p>Thanks so much for a great holiday at 'La Maison des Amis', a brilliant venue for families on holiday together.</p>
				<p>We all really enjoyed the house, garden and pool. Many thanks for your recommendations of the fête du vin de Gaillac - a truly great French experience and, by complete contrast, a great day out clambering through the trees at Le Cri du Tarzan.</p>
				<p>We can add a few suggestions of our own for future holidaymakers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the fabulous fête du Pain at beautiful, medieval Lautrec - August 15</li>
					<li>the delicious award-winning wine from Domaine Mas Pignon near Gaillac
						<li>And in case of emergency, e.g. a fall from a bike and embedded gravel in arm - the hospital at Lavaur works wonders!</li>

				<p>Thanks so much for your great hospitality.</p>
				<p>We couldn't have asked for more with the facilities offered in the house, there was something better and better around every corner, from the computer/sound system, to the trampoline and table tennis, to the pool area.</p>
				<p>Also thanks to yourselves and your family for your friendliness, good advice on things to do and places to go.</p>
				<p>Also thanks to the lads for the little snacks they kept bringing. We would love to return, this place really has it all!</p>
