				<p>We are Paul, Nadia, Samuel, Lochlann, Darrach and Thomas, &#8220;une famille recomposée&#8221;.</p>
				<p>We have traveled extensively throughout the world and have setup La Maison des Amis to cater primarily for families, with all the comforts of home.</p>
				<p>Paul has worked in the software industry since 1986, and is a founder at <a href="http://structure101.com" title="structure101.com">Structure101</a>.</p>
				<p>Nadia previously worked as a tour guide in South America and now teaches Spanish at the lycée in Gaillac.</p>
				<p>Samuel, Lochlann, Darrach and Thomas are all at collège.  When they can drag themselves away from the PlayStation, they play drums, handball, football and tennis.</p>
				<p>When we are not taxi-ing the boys around, we are happy to do what&#8217;s necessary to make your stay more comfortable.</p>
