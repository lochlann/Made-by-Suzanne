				<p>I am Susan, &#8220;Welcome to my web site.</p>
				<p>Where my aim is to make beautiful furniture pieces in wood that will last forever whether they be practical or just to be admired.</p>
				<p>I am a graduate of The Chippendale International School of Furniture and also of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers (Fine & Decorative Arts - architecture, furniture, art, silverware, rugs, costume, and decorations). In addition, my practical and artistic talents have been honed through my stucco work on restoring and reinstating ornate plasterwork.</p>
				<p>In all cases, whether it be making or restoring, I endeavour to use traditional methods and materials wherever possible.</p>
				<p> As every thing is handmade I feel it is a strength of my service to be able to provide exactly what my customer wants. So for example, if you need a non-standard size period-table to fit an alcove, and in a specific type of wood, then we can work together to achieve that.</p>
